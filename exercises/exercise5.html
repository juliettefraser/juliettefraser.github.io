        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/about-me-picture.jpg" alt="Juliette smiling with hands behind her back against a wood background">
        <p>I am currently a third-year student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, majoring in English with a minor in Information Technology. Alongside my studies, I'm pursuing a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communications, with the goal of venturing into technical writing post-graduation. </p>
        <p> Being an English major and IT minor, I am eager to expand my skills in a field that blends both language and technology. I have always been an avid book reader and have always loved writing creatively, but it was not until I started college where I found technical writing. I am excited to explore this field to help bridge the gap between complex concepts and clear, understandable language. </p> 
        <p>Feel free to reach out! I have attached my LinkedIn profile and my email address below.</p>
